summary: Given the importance of copepods we want to know how impacts of climate change, such as shifts in temperature and pH, might affect them – which may have knock-on effects for their predators and carbon cycling. Climate change will also have an indirect effect on food availability for copepods by impacting the algae they graze on, but we’re still learning how animals evolve at different levels of food abundance. One way to investigate evolutionary responses to food is to evolve copepods in a laboratory under controlled conditions.
