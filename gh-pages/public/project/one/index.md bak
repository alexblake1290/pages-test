summary: Copepods are not well known among the general public, but they play a vital role in the healthy functioning of our oceans. Copepods comprise most of the marine zooplankton, over 75% by biomass. They are an important source of food, providing the link between phytoplankton – which capture energy from the sun – and the wider marine foodwebs that need this energy to thrive. They also play a critical role in the carbon cycle, transferring large quantities of carbon into the deep ocean through their waste.
