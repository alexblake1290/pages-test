  With our eye for details, we noticed that product performance subtly differed across state lines. Higher temperatures clearly drove product failure in California, but the relationship was murkier in Florida.
  
  We prioritize client time and comprehension. As the problem expanded in complexity, so did our models. An important part of our work is unpacking the results for actionable insights. This helped us and our client to quickly zero in on a root cause and develop new product recommendations.
