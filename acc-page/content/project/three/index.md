  Dense cloud cover blocks UV rays and impedes crop photosynthesis – both impact product performance. Measuring cloudiness from raw imagery across many dates and sites required data mining and automation outside our client’s expertise.
  
  We extracted cloud cover around each farm during product application. The combination of cover and temperature was detrimental in a humid east-coast state like Florida but not in  dry California.
