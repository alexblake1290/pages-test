summary: We reared 20 populations of copepods for about 30 generations under high or low food levels over 1.5 years, then measured a variety of morphological and life cycle (life history) traits to see how they diverged. We found evidence that food level drove systemic change in life histories, including in adult size and growth patterns and offspring investment strategies.
